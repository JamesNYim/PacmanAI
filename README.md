# Pacman Ghost AI
This project demonstrates different search algorithms through the game of Pacman.

## Description
This project is based of of the [Berkeley AI Lab](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) This project was a way to learn about different search algorithms. These algorithms are then applied to Pacman Ghosts in order to give the ghosts a way to attack the Pacman player.
The work that I have done is in ``pacman/pacai/student``

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* Python >= 3.5
* The dependencies are writted in the **requirements.txt** and can be installed using:  ``pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt``

### How To Run
All the executables and binaries for the project are located in `pacai.bin` You can run these executables from the root directory (where this README.md is located) using the command:

`python3 -m pacai.bin.pacman`
